Core Azure Services:
1.Azure Storage Account:
An Azure Storage Account provides a cloud-based storage solution for various data types, such as files, blobs (binary large objects), queues, tables, and disks. It offers highly scalable, durable, and secure storage options for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. 
2.Azure Backup service:
 Azure Backup Service is a cloud-based solution designed to back up and restore data in the Microsoft cloud ecosystem. It offers scalable, secure, and cost-effective data protection for both on-premises and cloud workloads, ensuring data resiliency and compliance with minimal infrastructure.
3.Azure AI services:
 Azure AI Services encompass a wide range of artificial intelligence tools and APIs, such as Azure Cognitive Services and Azure Machine Learning. These services empower developers and data scientists to build intelligent applications with capabilities like natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics, leveraging pre-built models and customizable solutions for business needs.
4.Azure Blob storage:
 Azure Blob Storage is a highly scalable object storage service that allows users to store large amounts of unstructured data like text, images, and videos. Its pay-as-you-go model and various access tiers make it ideal for big data analytics, backups, and serving static content.
5.Azure Subscriptions: 
An Azure Subscription is an agreement with Microsoft to use Azure services. It is a logical container used to provision resources and manage costs and billing. Subscriptions are tied to an Azure account, which is associated with a specific billing profile.
